## A little about me

*Alternatively, you can read more about me on [my website's about page](https://www.caseyocampo.com/about/)*

I’m a 30-year-old living in South Florida. I grew up in this vacation state with two older brothers and was raised by an amazing single mom. My brothers and I are first-generation Americans.

In 2016, I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Central Florida. Like many others, it wasn’t long until after I graduated that I realized I didn’t want to pursue a career related to my degree (I majored in Sport and Exercise Science).

In early 2017, I committed to learning how to code so I could eventually break into the tech scene. From what I researched, a career in tech was exactly what I wanted: the opportunity to continue learning and problem-solve, a high earning potential, the possibility to work remotely, and I’d have the opportunity to contribute to something bigger than me.

Later on that year, I learned how to code on my own with the help of free online resources – mainly freecodecamp.com. It only took a few months of learning basic HTML and CSS for me to land a job in tech, albeit it was a job where I primarily coded emails. You can read more on how I learned to code and get a job on freeCodeCamp’s website.

Presently, I work full-time as a front-end developer; I also write here. This website is a project that brings me joy and serves as an outlet for me to talk in-depth about things I care about. I hope it serves as a useful and helpful place for you, too.
