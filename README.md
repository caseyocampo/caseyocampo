# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hi, I'm Casey. I'm a Front End Developer who cares about code and is always striving to be a better developer. I do this by reading books, taking courses, and writing about things I've learned about. I even started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLy7uZaVQ7nl5kBpixhH5wA) where I'm beginning to catalog things I've learned.

What makes me passionate about programming is that anyone can learn and create something meaningful. By learning how to code, you have the opportunity to create a positive change in the world by building useful applications for people. As humans, we're always looking for better, faster, and easier ways to navigate life and accomplish our goals; building useful software allows us to get those most out of life that we can.
