# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hi, I'm Casey. I'm a Front End Developer who cares about code and is always striving to be a better developer. I do this by reading books, taking courses, building projects, and writing about things I've learned about. I even started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLy7uZaVQ7nl5kBpixhH5wA) where I'm beginning to catalog things I've learned.

What makes me passionate about coding is that anyone can do it, as long as they put in consistent time and focus to learn.
